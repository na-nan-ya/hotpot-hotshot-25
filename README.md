# hotpot-hotshot-25
**The Project: Include your team name, and 2 to 3 sentences describing the goal of your project. What were your goals, and what did you accomplish over the weekend?**

Our team name is Hotpot Hotshot. The goal of the project was to design a gibberish detector using NLP modeling and neural network structures that would classify groups of words as actual english compared to gibberish. Over the weekend, we were able to collect and generate data sets of words, build a training model, and present the tool in a fun, on-theme Alice and Wonderland through our UI and front-end design. 

**The Team: Include the names of all your team members. For each, describe in a few words how they contributed to the project!**
Marin -- designed our UI (our Mad Hatter) and front-end model along with our presentation
Jessica -- collected and generated data sets, worked on creating and fine tuning the model 
Ananya -- brainstormed, built, and tested the NLP model
Presha -- connect our backend NLP model with the front end, worked on the design with Marin as well. 

**Acknowledgements: If your project uses major pieces of code from other sources— external libraries, other hackers, and ChatGPT— please cite them here! We’d love to give credit where credit’s due.**
_We used a variety of sources:_
 - _front end: Procreate, Figma_
 - _backend: ChatGPT, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Spacy, sklearn, faker, Kaggle_

**Optional Reflection: Because we love learning, tell us about what you learned this weekend!**
_With our project specifically We learend how to build NLP and neural networks using the libraries above, most of which we've never really used before. Furthermore, we learned the process of integrating frontend to backend._

**What motivated your team to choose this project? Are there bigger ideas or features for the project that you’d want to implement in the future?**
We were interested in the workings of ML and its application to NLP processing, and inspired by Jumbo Hack's theme of Alice in Wonderland. Therefore we decided to incorporate a prevalent motif of wonderland's chaos with our gibberish detector (sense and nonsense attributing to the Mad Hatter). 
In the future, we hope to incorporate our basic concept and design to integrate with different web applications or for data-cleaning and processing modules and softwate.

**Tell us about a tricky bug, a design challenge, or that you encountered. How did your team tackle it together?**
_We ran into many challenges. For example, Trying to process the data and uploading it to the repo was impossible as the data file generated was too big for the git to handle. To fix this I had to write a function that would split the data into many separate files for them to upload properly._ In addition, trying to figuring out what model to use and accuracy rates, understanding the APIs of new libraries that we've never used before were some of the other big challenges we faced. To solve these issues, it was about taking the time to understand and practice with the functions and variables necessary for the models and libraries to work. 

**Tell us about one fun or interesting experience that you had with other hackers! Did you get coffee with new friends? Did you attend a workshop that inspired you? Did you meet someone new?**
We met students from other schools, such as one from Colgate with which one of our teammates had a mutual connection with. We were excited for the SQL and webscraping workshops.
