Git is a tool for version control for your documents; mostly code
- push and pull on your own 
Github: "Git server" = manage version history with yourself 
    -central cloud server for browse code on github

Branch -- you work on your part and then bring back together. 
Key terminology:
    - Repository ('repo'): a folder of code GitHub is Tracking (top-hub folder with hold project)
    - Stage: area where you place changes before you commit them 
        - save changes in Git by putting them on a Stage
    - commit:

        - noun(a commit): a snapshot of your files at a given time
    - staging: 
        - control when the files are committed (staging first two files, then staging the third)
    - git status: where 
    - git add README #adds the readme to the bundled changes 
    - git add. #adds all of the changes 
        - git is green = knows  
    - tracking and staging pretty much mean the same thing; tracking (history)
- can uncommit a change 
    - revert back to previous versions 
    - git revert goes back to old version 
    - git log -- sees all commits that you've made and see the messages -m is message
